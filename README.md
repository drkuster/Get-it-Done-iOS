# Get it Done (iOS)
Get it Done is another to do list app... however it's more tailored to fit my needs. I've been using Apple's Reminders app to track homework assignments, meetings, etc for a couple years now. It works decently but it's also really glitchy and boring. More than anything, it lacks categories for days of the week (and no color!). Get it Done is here to fix Apple's shortcomings :-)
